        <p>I’ve heard the reports. Local fishermen who’ve been around for decades won’t go near the shoreline after dark. But here’s the weird part - there are nooooooo photos. Not a single one. You’d think someone would’ve caught it on camera by now, right? Something’s off about that. Something’s being hidden.</p>

        <p>Clearwater Worm? Probably just a huge sturgeon or something. I’m sure these people just aren’t used to seeing big fish. The real mystery is why the town let the shoreline become such a dumping ground for trash. Not everything has to be tied to some ancient creature.

        <p>Sounds like every other big fish tale but it isn't. My gramps swears he saw something as a kid! Said it was a big as a building, strong enough to beach a ship just from sailing near it.</p>
