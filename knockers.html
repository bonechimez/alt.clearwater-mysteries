    <p><strong>RE: Knocking Sounds – Theory, Not Final</strong></p>

   <p>This one’s older than the mine itself. You hear tapping once and you shrug it off. You hear it twice and it starts following a pattern. A third time, and it stops when you speak. That’s when you know you’re not alone down there.</p>

<p>Locals called them “Knockers.” Appalachian miners said “Tommyknockers,” likely borrowed from Cornish tales carried over by old world hands. It’s always something — fae, echoes, trapped air, the earth itself shifting. We give names to what we can't map. Doesn’t mean it's not real.</p>

<p>I've found notes about offerings. Cornwall, early shafts — they left scraps of their lunch. Mincemeat, crust, a bite of pasty. Superstition, maybe. Or maybe they were paying toll. Not to stay safe—but to be allowed to leave.</p>

<p>I’ll be back near the site in a week. Planning to get eyes on Shaft 4, maybe even further if it hasn’t collapsed. Just want to see for myself. These things loop around in your head if you don’t.</p>

<p>I’ll leave something behind — nothing big. Just a crust and a whisper. If I don’t post again, maybe it’s because nothing happened. Or maybe it’s because something did.</p>
